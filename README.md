# SIC_Microstrip
A Hardware Design and Simulation of a SIC circuit

SIC circuits , which will probably be used on 5G, consist on reduce the interference os transmited signals of received signals in Full-Duplex antennas.

The project was developped by Pedro Fornari using the Advanced Design System (ADS) from Agilent, avaiable in the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC).

This project tries to use microstrip to design the two main components of a SIC circuit, a combiner and a coupler, so the transmited signal should be isolated of the received signal. Non idealities of the components were used, as well as electromagnetic simulations to analize all the possible interferences this components could show.

For more information the reader can open the simulation and design files or the Report, wich shows the project sequence, as well as its qualities and defects.
